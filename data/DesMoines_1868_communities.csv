Davenport,-90.590833,41.543056,-93.628056,41.593611,"In 1850, the federal census recorded only ten Black residents in Davenport. The Black population increased signficantly during the war as refugees from southern slavery made their way to the city. In 1867, 298 of more than 34,000 Scott county residents were African American. During the war, members of the 108th U.S.C.T. were stationed across the river at Rock Island to guard Confederate and Sioux prisoners, and their occasional presence in Davenport led to several incidents of white violence against them. When the 60th U.S.C.T. mustered out at Davenport in October 1865, they held a state Colored Convention to assert their claims to the franchise and civil rights. In 1868, several Davenport residents participated in the convention:  J. Barber (call), Rev. P.C.Cooper (call & delegate), G. Reese (call), and John Warwick (call)."
Des Moines,-93.620833,41.590833,-93.628056,41.593611,"Des Moines (a small village at the time) had only 13 Black residents on the eve of the Civil War. By the end of the war, with many formerly enslaved people escaping the chaos of war in the South and making their way north to Iowa, the county's black population had grown to 91. Many of the wartime arrivals enlisted in the 60th U.S.C.T. The wartime population was large enough to host a July Fourth celebration in 1864 that drew more than fifty people, and by the summer of 1865, they had organized a school and a congregation of their own. In 1867, 263 African Americans lived in Polk County, most of them in Des Moines. Des Moines hosted the 1868 convention, and city residents Archy Brown (call), A. W. Cater (call), T. L. Carter (call and delegate), Walter White (delegate), and the Reverend S. T. Wells (call, delegate, and officer) participated."
Dubuque,-90.69,42.5,-93.628056,41.593611,"Dubuque, the site of Iowa's first European settlement, had a sizeable Black population in the 1830s, including both enslaved and free people. Some worked in the region's lead mines, others worked as roustabouts on the river. Several residents enlisted in the 60th U.S.C.T. Despite intense racism among white settlers, Black residents petititoned the city to provide schooling for their schldren soon after the war. The city's Black residents were reperesented at the 1868 convention by J. E. Huggard (delegate)."

By the close of the war the county's Black poulation had more than doubled. At least 21 men from the city enlisted in the 60th U.S.C.T., nearly all of them wartime refugees from southern slavery. The city's first Black congregation, Bethel A.M.E. church, was founded by a small group including James Howard, delegate to the 1868 convention. "
Keokuk,-91.385,40.397222,-93.628056,41.593611,"Two hundred miles north of St. Louis, Keokuk housed the state's earliest and largest Black community for much of the 19th century. By 1859, the city's black community had established an A.M.E. church and (in light of their exclusion from white schools) supported a Black-supervised, Black-taught school. A Baptist congregation was organized during the war, when a great many formerly enslaved people made their way to the city. On the eve of the war, the county held 245 Black residents, almost all of them in Keokuk. By the close of the war, that population had increased to 1043. The 60th U.S.C.T. was organized at Keokuk, as was the state's first Black Masonic lodge. Keokuk was represented at the 1868 convention by York Anderson (call and delegate), Reverend J.

Muscatine,-91.056111,41.423889,-93.628056,41.593611,"Following Keokuk, Muscatine became one of the state's earliest Black settlements, with 112 Black residents in the county in 1860. Surprisingly, city residents later in the 19th century recognized Muscatine's earliest black residents as part of the community's ""Old Settlers."" Muscatine's Black residents were at the forefront of the state's civil rights activism, hosting the state's first two conventions as well as submitting the first petititons to the state assembly against discriminatory laws. The community organized both an A.M.E. congregation and a school for Black children prior to the war. Muscatine's sole representative at the 1868 convention was Alexander Clark (call and delegate)."
Newton,-93.046944,41.698611,-93.628056,41.593611,"During the Civil War, a number of formerly-enslaved people escaped slavery in Missouri and settled in Newton and the surrounding countryside. The 1870 census records 69 Black residents in the county. A large proportion of the Black men who came to wartime Newton enlisted in the 60th U.S.C.T., and on their return at the close of the war, the community quickly established an A.M.E. congregation as well as a school for their children. Newton's sole representative at the 1868 convention was Marshall Holloway (delegate)."

By the end of 1865, the community had organized an A.M.E. church as well as a school for Black children. The county's Black poulation increased signficantly in the late 1870s and 1880s as the growing coal mining industry recruited Black laborers from the South.

Ft. Madison,-91.338889,40.628611,-93.628056,41.593611,"Founded in the 1830s on the ruins of an Army fort erected to defend U.S. interests in Sac and Fox territory, the town's very small Black population consisted of former slaves, some brought by former owners. The town's residents were essential to river traffic on the MIssissippi; shallow rapids between Keokuk and Ft. Madison required ships be unloaded and their goods carted overland, providing employment for many. Addison Morris signed the call for the 1868 convention."
Mt. Pleasant,-91.551111,40.966944,-93.628056,41.593611,"From two dozen African Americans on the eve of the war, Mt. Pleasant and Henry County saw a wartime increase in its Black population to 262 at the end of the war.

Whites also provided a (segregated) school for the town's Black children, while the Black community organized its own congregations. On the eve of the convention, the county held more than 400 Black residents. At the 1868 convention, Mt. Pleasant was represented only in the call, which was signed by Reverend S. Nichols."
